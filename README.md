# CS-330_Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization

This class was predominantly focused on teaching the Basics of the Computer Graphics Rendering Pipeline by utilizing the OpenGL API in a C++ coding Environment. The Course culminated in the submission of a Final Project that demonstrates understanding of 3-Dimensional Rendering of Shapes, Textures and Lighting.

*How do I approach designing software?*
My Approach to software design involves iterative testing and understanding entirely the project requirements, the scope of the project, and how to most efficiently implement those requirements. This 8 week course was a journey in learning the OpenGL API and determining the best way to organize the program to allow for a better developer experience. Along the way I learned a variety of Graphics Computing approaches to make my scene the best it could be. 

*What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?*
This project has given me a many new design skills to consider. Building this program allowed for learning new avenues of program organization to best manage resources and different modules of the graphics computing process.

*What design process did you follow for your project work?*
The Design Process I followed on a weekly basis was assessing the Graphics Computing Concept being applied, applying that new graphics computing concept in an Assignment Project, and then Implementing the Graphics Computing Design Concept in the final project. This allowed for a lot of initial experimentation and understanding before ever trying to apply the concept to the Final Project.

*How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?*
The Tactics I've learned in this course I intend to apply to all of my future design work. It was a really good strategy to understand the concept in a sandbox before ever applying it to the final Project. I can utilize this in the Professional world by heavily relying on Version Control.

*How do I approach developing programs?*
I develop programs in an iterative process. By being methodical in the planning and requirements gathering, a lot of overhead can be avoided by focusing on the scope and requirements at the start. Within this planning phase is researching what programming languages and packages exist that enable the desired functionality. Within Computer Science there are *a lot* of ways to do the same thing and not all are created equal.

*What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?*
The newest development strategy I used in this course was tweaking values. The Graphics Computing process has a lot of rendering steps that lend themselves to experimentation. I regularly found myself altering the vertex and indice calculation steps of a Mesh, or changing the orientation of objects in their x, y, z coordinates. Additionally the lighting calculations were a lot of fun to experiment with. 

*How did iteration factor into your development?*
Iteration was a weekly process within this course. I found that with the graphics rendering pipeline the best way to learn was to break everything down into the smallest steps possible and build iteratively. I spent many 3-6 hour codding sessions going step-by-step to avoid simple mistakes.

*How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?*
My approach to development evolved a lot during this course. The focus on Program Organization and Modularization really helped me evolve. It's extremely advantageous to have a program organized in a manner that adding or removing resources and functionality is straightforward. I learned to think "A place for a process" instead of grouping a lot of functionality in singular areas.

*How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?*
Computer Science helps me in reaching my ultimate goal, which is enabling people to do amazing things. Computer Science is a force multiplier upon the modern world that enables people to be capable of amazing things. Sometimes all that is needed is a program or function that enables faster and more efficient application of ideas. 

*How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?*
Computation Graphics and Visualizations has opened up a whole new way of thinking as it relates to Discrete Mathematics. While I enjoyed Discrete Mathematics Theoretically, applying the concepts of Matrice Math in this course really opened my eyes to the power of Mathematical computing.
